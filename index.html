                    <h3>Thank you for visiting!</h3>
                    <p>Hi!
                            I'm looking to level up my career and challenge myself like I've never done before.  I've loved computers my whole life, and I love solving technical problems.  After my diverse background in management, customer service and now in IT, I've decided I'd love to advance in the technology industry.  I've completed a Udemy course for Python and am currently training in Python, Web Development and Computer Science on CodeCademy.com.  I'm more confident than ever about my career goals and can't wait to see where I land.</p>

                    <h3>My Career Goals</h3>
                    <p>Hi there!

                            I've loved computer my whole life as my dad always had a bunch of computers lying around the house. I spent hours apon hours tinkering with them and my own to try and understand them. At the time my Mom had a C++ for dummies book that she gave me to start coding back when I was still in grade school. I remember going through the first few chapters, though, feelling very overwhelmed by it all. Eventually I did end up making a game but I don't remember much more than that.
                            
                            After moving out of my parents house I got a callcenter job a a customer service representative and worked up to supervisor. I love leading others however the whole envirement just didn't feel suited for me.
                            
                            I spotted the "Desktop Engineer" position that opened up for the site I worked at and applied and GOT IT! I was very excited and fully enjoyed the work. During my time there more and more became repetative as I felt I stopped learning new things. All the while I really needed to make more money to have a less money stresed life and looking at other desktop positions in my city seamed to pay the same.
                            
                            1-2 skip a few and now I'm in back end IT programming cisco phones. Definitely making more money but not feeling challened and I can smell automation happening in this position in a few years time.
                            
                            In the passed couple years I've learned quickly that the biggest things holding me back is the fear I won't be able to pull something off. First it was with the supervisor position but in the end I could do it! Then it was troubleshooting and computers but I ended up doing it as well. No more fear. I'm going to tackle what I tried when I was in grade school, but this time I'm doing python.
                            
                            Now I'm doing the 100 day coding challenge learning Python and I'm a week in. Already I feel I'm catching on drastically faster than I did back in the day. I feel more deteremined then I've felt about anyhting else.
                            
                            Action time.</p>
